				Fruit is a little different, though. Fruits are seasonally grown, can only grow in specific
				environments, and need to be kept in specific conditions to remain fresh for the end
				consumer. As such, there is a large degree of variability in how much certain fruits cost.

			<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
				This makes fruits act as a microcosm of the grocery market. Looking at the prices of fruits
				can leave clues as to the economic viability of foreign imports from certain countries over

				to spoil? Which are harder to grow?

					Looking at the full graph, there are a few trends that jump out immediately. For one,
					small fruits like berries are far more likely to be expensive. Interestingly, tropical
					fruits are the least expensive, despite needing to grow in very specific environments.

				<p class="mt-8 py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
					Raspberries ($7.73/lb) and blackberries ($6.75/lb) are among the most expensive fruits
					when bought fresh. This is because they are both small, fragile berries. Berries are
					always hand-picked, being very difficult to automate due to their variability in time to
					ripen and their small size. Raspberries are especially bad, being extremely quick to spoil
					and picky about the season they grow in.<Link
						href="https://www.mashed.com/196372/why-are-raspberries-so-expensive/"
						><sup>1</sup></Link
					> Special care needs to be put into their harvest and transport to ensure that they aren't
					crushed or spoiled by the time they reach the final buyer. This explains its price nearly doubling
					that of the third most expensive fruit, cherries.
				</p>
				<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
					Cherries ($4.66/lb) also fall victim to the small fruit problem and are difficult to
					automate because of that fact. They're hard to grow well, being grown mainly in a 4-month
					period between late spring and early summer in California, Oregon, and Washington. They
					are also not ripe for very long, needing to be carefully monitored to ensure they don't
					spoil.<Link href="https://www.mashed.com/194002/why-are-cherries-so-expensive/"
						><sup>2</sup></Link
					>
				</p>
				<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
					Strawberries ($2.97/lb) suffer from the berry problem, but are a little bigger and
					tougher. Additionally, strawberries can grow in a variety of climates and soil types,
					which gives growers much more flexibility in how they are grown. They have a longer
					growing season, which helps to extend their supply window.

						The abundance and affordability of tropical fruits is deeply tied to Caribbean labor
						exploitation dating back to the late 1800s. You can read more about it <Link

					Narrowing in on the tropical fruits reveals that mangoes ($1.47/lb) are easily the most
					expensive of the bunch, easily doubling the price of pineapples ($0.62/lb) and bananas
					($0.60/lb). Considering that they all grow in similar climates, this doesn't make much
					sense at first. However, mangoes are heavier than bananas without having the rugged
					exterior that pineapples and watermelons do. They need to be specially packaged to ensure
					that they both won't smash other fruits and won't get smashed themselves.
				</p>
				<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
					But watermelons ($0.38/lb) are incredibly heavy, right? So why would they be the cheapest
					fruit to buy fresh? For one, watermelons have tough rinds that keep bacteria and animals
					out. This means that growers don't need to worry about cutting into their profit margins
					buying pesticides. Since watermelons greatly vary in size, grocery supply chains will
					usually buy the cheapest watermelons (small ones) in order to pass those savings on to the
					consumer. Buyers won't notice a small drop in quality, but they will notice an increase in
					price.
				</p>
				<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
					Since we are comparing prices pound-for-pound, watermelons enjoy a distinct advantage
					here, being both heavy (full of water!) and easy to distribute since it doesn't take many
					of them to fill up a pallet.

				At first glance, frozen fruit seems to mirror that of fresh berries. In some ways, this is
				true. The rankings are exactly the same, with raspberries being on top for most expensive,
				followed by blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries. However, the deviation between
				fruit prices is much tighter this time around.

				Try swapping between frozen and fresh prices and pay close attention to the levels. You can
				see the gap between blackberries and blueberries visibly close when the label swaps from
				fresh to frozen. Looking at the y-axis, you can see that frozen raspberries ($6.16/lb) cost
				over a dollar less than buying them fresh ($7.73/lb). Frozen berries just cost less than
				their fresh counterparts.
			</p>
			<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
				Why? Because frozen produce can be kept nearly indefinitely. Since berries are quick to
				perish, distributors can keep their existing supply of berries for longer, and have a grace
				period between harvesting and delivering to the end consumer.
			</p>
			<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
				This is absolutely vital when you consider that berries very beholden to their harvest
				seasons.<Link

					><sup>3</sup></Link
				> When frozen, berries can last well into the winter months where fresh fruit would go bad. The
				savings that come from this long-term storage are passed on to the consumer, leading to frozen
				berries costing anywhere from $0.34 to $1.57 less than they would if they were picked fresh.

				Cherries immediately jump out as an outlier here. Most of the fruits average around $2/lb,
				but cherries sit at a staggering $5.24/lb. This is for a few reasons. For one, the other
				fruits are significantly larger than cherries, and thus distributors need to fill a single
				can with way more cherries for a can of the same volume. Also, the canning process can add a
				decent amount to cost. Even if the aluminum used in the cans themselves are cheap, the
				cherries need to be processed in a factory that they wouldn't have otherwise visited, which
				adds a non-insignificant amount to shipping costs, especially when travelling
				internationally. As stated, cherries are also just expensive.

				Comparing to fresh fruit again, flipping back-and-forth shows that cherries are expensive no
				matter the form. Switching to fresh only subtracts $0.58 from the final cost. The other
				fruits are far more interesting, however.
			</p>
			<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
				It's important to mention that while the canning process can be pricey and time-consuming,
				the resulting product is shelf stable, unlike fresh fruit. This gives canned fruits a
				distinct advantage in the supply chain.
			</p>
			<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
				This is particularly relevant when talking about apricots, which sell at $3.62/lb when
				fresh, and drop down to $2.24 when canned. That is a $1.38 difference! This goes against
				conventional wisdom in that you pay a premium for canned goods and their shelf stability.
				While not as extreme, peaches follow this trend too, falling $0.17 under the cost of buying
				fresh.
			</p>
			<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
				So why is this? The best explanation can be found by observing their peak season. Peaches
				and apricots are both at their peak harvest during the summer months. Apricots specifically
				tend to grow erratically, having a tiny window in which they are ripe and ready to eat.<Link
					href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/1996/08/06/the-tasty-apricot-is-a-misunderstood-fruit/b47d4e49-44b7-449e-a5e7-09f62882bf69/"
					><sup>4</sup></Link
				> Distributors trying to sell fresh apricots need to time their shipping to ensure that the apricot
				gets in the hands of the consumer with at least a day or two's worth of a grace period before
				ripeness. Even if everything goes perfectly, grocery stores can't cycle out apricots daily, and
				some apricots may sit on the shelf longer than others.
			</p>
			<p class="py-3 font-proximaNova text-lg">
				If distributors can the fruits themselves, however, they are able to capture the fruit in
				its peak ripeness and keep it from developing any further. This gives suppliers much more
				control over how the consumer will enjoy the product instead of passing the fresh fruit over
				to a grocer and hoping for the best.

				Dried fruits are more expensive on average than any other type of fruit for one simple
